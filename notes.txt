Unit 2 Freelancer Forum (Notes)

1. Create HTML file and connected JS file

2. HTML does not contain any hard-coded data about freelancer names, occupations or starting prices.

3. Create an array containing list of freelancers (include name, occupation, starting price)
  Ex. {name: "Alice", occupation: "Writer", price: 30},
      {name: "Bob", occupation: "Teacher", price: 50}

4. Use document.querySelector, which selects the first element

5. Program initializes an array of possible names and an array of possible occupations

6. Average starting price
  Ex: Alice & Bob, avg: $40

7. setInterval, a few secs later, repeats
  name: Carol, occupation: Programmer, starting price: $70

8. Average updated to $50
